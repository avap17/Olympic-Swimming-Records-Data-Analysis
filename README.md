# Olympic-Swimming-Records-Data-Analysis Project Introduction and Goal
In this project, I analyze records of Olympic Swimming history from 1912 to 2020. The goals of this project are to:
1) Analyze the historical trends in medal wins for each country.
2) Analyze the distribution of medals between male and female athletes for each country.
3) Analyze whether there is a positive correlation between the year and the number of medals earned.

# Dataset
This dataset is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasciencedonut/olympic-swimming-1912-to-2020. Some of the important information it contains includes athletes and their teams, ranking results, etc.

# Data Exploration and Visualization
In this project I explore the dataset through significant statistics and analyzing correlation between different factors compared to medals won. I also use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize my data exploration.
